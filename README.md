# FinalWinny### TheWinForm Authentication System

This C# code snippet demonstrates an authentication system and order processing logic designed for a WinForm application. Let's break down the structure and functionality of this code.

#### Overview

The code consists of the following components:

1. **Authentication Class**: Contains classes and methods related to user authentication and order processing.
   
2. **User Class**: Represents a user and contains user-related properties.
   
3. **Order Class**: Represents an order and contains properties related to an order, along with methods for setting orders and ratings.
   
4. **DatabaseManager Class**: Responsible for handling database operations, including user authentication.

#### User Authentication

The `DatabaseManager` class handles user authentication through the `AuthenticateUser` method. It queries the database for user credentials and returns a `User` object if authentication is successful.

#### Order Processing

The `Order` class facilitates order processing. It allows setting orders with the `setOrder` method, which retrieves relevant information from the database based on user inputs such as start and end destinations and car type. It then inserts the order details into the database.

#### Database Interaction

The code utilizes `SqlConnection` and `SqlCommand` classes to interact with a SQL Server database. It executes queries to retrieve user information and insert order details.

#### Notes

- The code uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Error handling is implemented to manage exceptions during database operations.
- Debug statements are used for logging and troubleshooting.
- The code seems to be designed for a specific database schema (`TAXIDDV`) and environment (`LAB109PC16\SQLEXPRESS`).

#### Usage

To use this code:

1. Ensure the SQL Server instance and database (`TAXIDDV`) are set up correctly.
2. Replace placeholders like `LAB109PC16\SQLEXPRESS` with your database server information.
3. Integrate the provided classes and methods into your WinForm application.
4. Customize the database queries and logic as per your application's requirements.

This code provides a foundation for implementing user authentication and order processing in a WinForm application. Customize and extend it according to your specific use case and requirements.
